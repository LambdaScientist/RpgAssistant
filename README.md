TODO List:
- Add monoid for these types to prevent duplicates from appearing
  * After we figure out how we want to do the implementationn
  * Would need to start looking at Tags to make sure no bonus of the same type stacks 
- Add some quickCheck tests
- Decide if lenses are needed
  * Research how we could use them
- Add a simple charater sheet reader, player is currently simple
  * Should I do this as a flexible parser?
